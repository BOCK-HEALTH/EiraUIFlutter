âœ… Local Workflow Recap

Youâ€™ve correctly structured your setup into two independent parts:

1. Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)

.env file defines database and secret configs.

Runs locally on http://localhost:8080.

2. Frontend (Flutter Web)

Uses lib/api_service.dart to define:

final String _baseUrl = "http://localhost:8080";


Communicates with the backend through that base URL.

Can be launched using:

flutter run -d chrome

ðŸš€ For AWS EC2 + Apache Deployment (Next Step)

Now that your local setup works, the goal is to replace localhost with your EC2 backend public IP and host your Flutter build on Apache.
Hereâ€™s how this maps out:

Component	Location	Command / Config	Notes
Frontend (Flutter Web)	/var/www/html/ on EC2	sudo cp -r build/web/* /var/www/html/	Served by Apache
Backend (Node.js)	Same or another EC2 instance	npm start or pm2 start server.js	Must listen on port 8080
API Endpoint in Flutter	lib/api_service.dart	final String _baseUrl = "http://<backend-ec2-ip>:8080";	Replace localhost
ðŸ”§ Example Configuration for Your Case

Since you mentioned:

Backend IP = 16.171.29.159

Apache is also on 16.171.29.159

Then in lib/api_service.dart, use:

final String _baseUrl = "http://16.171.29.159:8080";


Then build and deploy:

flutter build web
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
sudo cp -r build/web/* /var/www/html/
sudo systemctl restart apache2


Now visiting
ðŸ‘‰ http://16.171.29.159/

will load your Flutter frontend, and API requests will reach your Node backend at http://16.171.29.159:8080.
